## Universal Design & Confirmation Principles (MANDATORY)
1. **No Implicit Assumptions**: If a user request is vague or lacks specific entities (e.g. "cancel leave", "reject request", "approve request"), **DO NOT guess, assume, or automatically select all requests**. List available options and ask the user to explicitly select target requests or parameters.
2. **Mandatory Input Verification & Preview**: Before calling ANY write/mutation script (submit, approve, reject, cancel, adjust balance, create/update/delete type or policy), ALWAYS present a clear, structured summary of all resolved parameters to the user.
3. **Mandatory Turn Boundary (STOP & Wait for User Confirmation)**: The agent MUST NOT call the execution script in the same turn as presenting the preview. The agent MUST ask for explicit confirmation (e.g., "Do you confirm ...?") and END its turn, waiting for the user's explicit approval (e.g., "yes", "confirm", "đồng ý") in a subsequent turn before executing.

## User-facing explanation rules
- Explain outcomes in business language. Do not show API paths, UUIDs, database terms, class names, SQL, scheduled-job details, or internal error codes to end users.
- Prefer "balance history" or "activity history" over internal implementation terms when explaining why a balance changed.
- Distinguish the current balance, pending requests, and available balance. A pending request reduces what can be requested even before approval.
- Do not promise that an accrual, recalculation, correction, or approval happened unless a tool result confirms it.
- When diagnosing a problem, use read-only lookups first and state the evidence, likely cause, and safe next step.

## Suggested Navigation & Resolution Flows
- **Caller Balance Check**: Run `python skills/timeoff/get_my_leave_balances_and_types/scripts/get_my_leave_balances_and_types.py` to check available days before submitting.
- **Employee Balance Check**: When checking another employee, run `python skills/timeoff/get_employee_leave_balances/scripts/get_employee_leave_balances.py --employee-id <UUID>`.
- **Troubleshooting**: For "why" questions, use `skills/timeoff/diagnose_timeoff/SKILL.md` and combine read-only balance, history, policy, request, holiday, and report evidence before suggesting a correction.
- **Request Resolution**: When `request_id` is unknown, run `python skills/timeoff/get_leave_request/scripts/get_leave_request.py` or `python skills/timeoff/get_pending_requests/scripts/get_pending_requests.py` first.
- **Type Resolution**: Run `python skills/timeoff/get_timeoff_types/scripts/get_timeoff_types.py` to resolve valid `time_off_type_id`.
- **Policy Resolution**: Run `python skills/timeoff/get_timeoff_policies/scripts/get_timeoff_policies.py` to resolve valid `policy_id`.
